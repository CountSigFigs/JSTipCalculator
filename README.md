# JSTipCalculator
Tip Calculator created with javascript, html, and css


Background designed from particle.js: https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/
To get experience with javascript and mantipulating the DOM, I created a javascript 
calculator that takes in user experience and bill amount and outputs the amount of 
tip you should give.
